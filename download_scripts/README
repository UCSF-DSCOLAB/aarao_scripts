Step 1: Take the ihg links for each library you want to download and add it to ${PROJECT}/get_${PROJECT}_n.list where n is increasing from 1.

Step 2: Run the command
	# Assumes username is krummelm
	bash spawn_download_10x_from_ihg.sh ${PROJECT}/get_${PROJECT}_n.list
        # Specifically pass in a username
	bash spawn_download_10x_from_ihg.sh ${PROJECT}/get_${PROJECT}_n.list krummelm


The download will be spawned as a cluster job and results will be stored in ihg-client.ucsf.edu/${USERNAME}.

Specifics:
The files at /krummellab/data1/immunox/staging/wgetrcs/ hold a username and password for the downloads so nefarious agents cannot swipe your password from the top/ps/htop outputs.

To add a new username to use with this script, create a file called `/krummellab/data1/immunox/staging/wgetrcs/new_username` then populate the file with
```
user=new_username
password=new_password
```
